foundation-sprockets
--------------------
All the goodness of [zurb/foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation), but with imports managed by sprockets.

Inspired by [this blog post](http://blog.55minutes.com/2013/01/lightning-fast-sass-reloading-in-rails-32/)

# Usage
    // In your desired scss file (e.g. application.css.scss)
    //= require foundation-sprockets/scss_sprockets/foundation

See the [official Foundation website](http://foundation.zurb.com/) for all other usage.

## With rails

* This package is designed to be used with bower (try [bower-rails](https://github.com/42dev/bower-rails))
* The [sass-rails](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails) gem is also required.
